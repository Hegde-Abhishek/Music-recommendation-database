# Music-Recommendation-Database

  A Music Database with carefully chosen entities such as songs, albums, genres, artists, and record labels.
The project has a command-line interface that offers database capabilities like adding and deleting data,
altering values, sorting by an attribute, building views, and performing various queries.
Choose any song based on your preference or mood. The database will display a playlist, or
a list of recommended songs based on the genre, song or artist chosen.

Use-case for un-authorized users:

1. Search songs and albums through database using input keywords.
2. View recently added albums and its details.
3. View custom music playlist and get recommendations based on it.

Use-case for authorized users(admin):
